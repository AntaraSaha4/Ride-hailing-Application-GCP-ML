Ride-hailing Application

•	Created a cab fare prediction app that estimates the cost of a ride based on the pickup and drop-off locations using historical data. The app can respond to voice queries about ride fares with voice-based answers. It also accepts images of landmarks as the trip's pickup and drop-off locations.

•	After incorporating advanced feature engineering, I used XGBoost as the ML algorithm and trained the model on Google Vertex AI to predict the fare.

•	I have developed multiple APIs using GCP APIs to implement various functionalities for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
